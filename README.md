# Fine-tuning OpenAI's Models for JSON Output Formatting

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune one of OpenAI's key models to achieve JSON output formatting for generating fake identity data. By leveraging fine-tuning, we can get better steerability, shorter prompts, and therefore, reduced costs.

## Project Description

Often, in the development stages, there's a need to generate structured data to seed our databases, populate dashboards, etc. This project specifically focuses on generating Twitter-like user profiles in a structured format.

With the fine-tuned model, the aim is to reduce the number of tokens used in a prompt without compromising on the quality of the response. This project shows you how to:

- Prepare synthetic training data
- Format the data according to OpenAI's guidelines
- Fine-tune the model using the prepared data
- Test the fine-tuned model

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Include your OpenAI API key in your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXX"
   ```

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the article to generate the training data, fine-tune the model, and test it.

### Project Files and Their Descriptions

1. `requirements.txt`
   - **Purpose**: Lists all the required Python packages and libraries for this project.

2. `prepare_data.py`
   - **Purpose**: Contains scripts to generate synthetic training data for model fine-tuning.

3. `transform_data.py`
   - **Purpose**: Formats the synthetic data according to OpenAI's guidelines.

4. `openai_formatting.py`
   - **Purpose**: Validates the data formatting according to OpenAI's guidelines. Counts tokens. [Source](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/check-data-formatting).

5. `finetuning.py`
   - **Purpose**: Contains scripts and instructions to fine-tune the OpenAI model with the prepared data.

5. `run_model.py`
   - **Purpose**: Allows users to test the fine-tuned model by generating JSON formatted data.

6. `training_examples.json`
   - **Purpose**: Output of `prepare_data.py` so you don't have to pay for generating synthetic data again.
